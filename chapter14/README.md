django.contrib
==============

The Django standard library

- admin

- admindocs: pulls documentation from the docstrings of models, views,
  template tags, and template filters for any app in INSTALLED_APPS
  and makes that documentation available from the Django admin.

- auth

- contenttypes: A framework for hooking into “types” of content, where
  each installed Django model is a separate content type.

- flatpages: It lets you store simple “flat” HTML content in a database
  and handles the management for you via Django’s admin interface and a
  Python API.

- gis: GIS (Geographic Information Systems) support

- humanize

- messages

- redirects

- sessions

- sitemaps: a high-level sitemap-generating framework that makes creating
  sitemap XML files easy.

        Sitemaps are an easy way for webmasters to inform search engines
        about pages on their sites that are available for crawling. In
        its simplest form, a Sitemap is an XML file that lists URLs for
        a site along with additional metadata about each URL (when it was
        last updated, how often it usually changes, and how important it
        is, relative to other URLs in the site) so that search engines
        can more intelligently crawl the site.

- sites: lets you operate multiple Web sites from the same database and
  Django installation.

- staticfiles

        collectstatic
        serve static files in development

- syndication: feed generating framework. RSS/Atom

- webdesign: provides various Django helpers that are particularly useful
  to Web designers (as opposed to developers).
